You can install pip on your Linux VM by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip
```

If you don't have Python installed, you can install it along with pip using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

You can use the `split()` method to split the line into two parts, and then convert each part to an integer using the `int()` function. Here's an example:

```python
def split_line(line):
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    return a, b
```

This function takes a line as input, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer using the `map()` function, and returns the two integers as a tuple.

You can use this function like this:

```python
line = "123 456"
a, b = split_line(line)
print(a)  # prints 123
print(b)  # prints 456
```

The `split()` method is a string method in Python that splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. 

The syntax of `line.split()` is as follows:

```python
line.split(delimiter)
```

- `line` is the string you want to split.
- `delimiter` is an optional argument that specifies the character or characters to use as the delimiter for splitting the string. If `delimiter` is not provided, the method splits the string at whitespace by default.

The `split()` method returns a list of substrings. Each substring is a portion of the original string that was separated by the delimiter.

Here's an example:

```python
line = "Hello, world! This is a test."
words = line.split()
print(words)  # prints ['Hello,', 'world!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'test.']

line = "123-456-789"
numbers = line.split('-')
print(numbers)  # prints ['123', '456', '789']
```

Yes, the `split()` method without a specified delimiter (i.e., `split()`) will treat multiple whitespace characters as one delimiter. This means that it will split on the first whitespace character it encounters and ignore any subsequent whitespace characters until it encounters a non-whitespace character.

Here's an example:

```python
line = "Hello   world!  This  is  a  test."
words = line.split()
print(words)  # prints ['Hello', 'world!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'test.']
```

As you can see, the multiple whitespace characters between the words are treated as a single delimiter, and the resulting list contains the individual words without any extra empty strings.

However, if you specify a delimiter other than whitespace, the `split()` method will treat each occurrence of that delimiter as a separate split point. For example:

```python
line = "Hello,, world!,, This,, is,, a,, test."
words = line.split(',')
print(words)  # prints ['Hello', '', ' world!', '', ' This', '', ' is', '', ' a', '', ' test.']
```

In this case, the multiple commas are treated as separate delimiters, resulting in empty strings in the output list.

You can use the built-in `sorted()` function in Python to sort your list. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [4, 2, 9, 6, 1]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print(sorted_list)  # prints [1, 2, 4, 6, 9]
```

Alternatively, you can use the `sort()` method, which sorts the list in-place (i.e., modifies the original list):

```python
my_list = [4, 2, 9, 6, 1]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # prints [1, 2, 4, 6, 9]
```

Both `sorted()` and `sort()` can take additional arguments to customize the sorting behavior, such as:

* `reverse=True` to sort in descending order
* `key=function` to specify a custom sorting key

For example:

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=len)
print(sorted_list)  # prints ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

The `zip()` function in Python takes two or more iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) as input and returns an iterator that aggregates them in a tuple.

In other words, `zip()` pairs up the corresponding elements from each iterable and returns them as a tuple.

Here's an example:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
zipped = zip(list1, list2)
print(list(zipped))  # prints [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```

Note that `zip()` stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. If the iterables are of different lengths, the remaining elements from the longer iterables are ignored.

For example:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
zipped = zip(list1, list2)
print(list(zipped))  # prints [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
```

In this case, the extra element `'d'` from `list2` is ignored.

You can also use `zip()` with more than two iterables:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list3 = ['x', 'y', 'z']
zipped = zip(list1, list2, list3)
print(list(zipped))  # prints [(1, 'a', 'x'), (2, 'b', 'y'), (3, 'c', 'z')]
```

You can use the `count()` method in Python to check how many times a number appears in a list. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2]
number = 2
count = my_list.count(number)
print(count)  # prints 3
```

In this example, `my_list.count(number)` returns the number of times `number` appears in `my_list`.

Alternatively, you can use a loop to count the occurrences manually:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2]
number = 2
count = 0
for item in my_list:
    if item == number:
        count += 1
print(count)  # prints 3
```

In this case, you iterate over each item in `my_list` and increment `count` whenever you encounter `number`.

Yes, the `split()` method in Python returns a list of strings.

When you call `split()` on a string, it splits the string into substrings based on the specified delimiter (or whitespace by default) and returns a list containing these substrings.

Here's an example:

```python
my_string = "hello world"
result = my_string.split()
print(type(result))  # prints <class 'list'>
print(result)  # prints ['hello', 'world']
```

In this case, `split()` returns a list containing two strings: `'hello'` and `'world'`.

Note that if the input string is empty or contains only the delimiter, `split()` may return an empty list or a list containing an empty string. For example:

```python
my_string = ""
result = my_string.split()
print(result)  # prints []

my_string = "   "
result = my_string.split()
print(result)  # prints []

my_string = ","
result = my_string.split(",")
print(result)  # prints ['', '']
```

You can use a list comprehension to convert the strings returned by `split()` into integers. Here's an example:

```python
line = "1 2 3 4 5"
numbers = [int(num) for num in line.split()]
print(numbers)  # prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, `line.split()` splits the line into a list of strings representing the numbers. The list comprehension `[int(num) for num in line.split()]` then converts each string into an integer using the `int()` function and returns a list of integers.

You can also use the `map()` function to achieve the same result:

```python
line = "1 2 3 4 5"
numbers = list(map(int, line.split()))
print(numbers)  # prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, `map(int, line.split())` applies the `int()` function to each element of the list returned by `line.split()`, and `list()` converts the resulting iterator into a list.

You can use the following expressions to check if a list is all increasing or decreasing:

**All Increasing:**
```python
all(x < y for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))
```
**All Decreasing:**
```python
all(x > y for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))
```
Here, `lst` is the input list.

The `zip(lst, lst[1:])` expression pairs each element with the next one, and the `all()` function checks if all pairs satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, you can use the following expressions:

**All Increasing:**
```python
lst == sorted(lst)
```
**All Decreasing:**
```python
lst == sorted(lst, reverse=True)
```
These expressions work by comparing the original list with its sorted version. If the list is already sorted in the desired order, then it is all increasing or decreasing.

Note that these expressions assume that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it is considered both increasing and decreasing.

You can use the following expression to check that the difference between consecutive elements in a list is at least 1 and at most 3:

```python
all(1 <= y - x <= 3 for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))
```

This expression uses the `all()` function to check that the condition `1 <= y - x <= 3` is true for all pairs of consecutive elements in the list.

Here's how it works:

* `zip(lst, lst[1:])` pairs each element with the next one.
* `y - x` calculates the difference between each pair of elements.
* `1 <= y - x <= 3` checks that the difference is at least 1 and at most 3.
* `all()` checks that this condition is true for all pairs of elements. If any pair fails the condition, `all()` returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

You can use a loop to successively remove a single element from the report list and check the safety of the resulting subset. Here's an example:
```python
def check_safety(lst):
    # your safety check function here
    return all(1 <= y - x <= 3 for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))

report_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

for i in range(len(report_list)):
    subset = report_list[:i] + report_list[i+1:]
    if check_safety(subset):
        print(f"Removing element {report_list[i]} results in a safe subset: {subset}")
    else:
        print(f"Removing element {report_list[i]} does not result in a safe subset: {subset}")
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over the indices of the report list. For each index `i`, it creates a subset by removing the element at index `i` from the original list. It then checks the safety of the resulting subset using the `check_safety` function. If the subset is safe, it prints a message indicating that removing the element results in a safe subset. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that removing the element does not result in a safe subset.

Note that this code assumes that the `check_safety` function takes a list as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is safe or not. You'll need to modify the `check_safety` function to match your specific safety check.

Sure, here's an example of a `.gitignore` file that excludes any text files with the name "puzzle_input.txt" from being uploaded to GitHub:

```
# Ignore puzzle input files
puzzle_input.txt
```

You can save this file in the root directory of your repository with the name `.gitignore`. Git will automatically ignore any files or directories that match the patterns specified in the `.gitignore` file.

In this case, the `.gitignore` file specifies a single pattern: `puzzle_input.txt`, which matches any text file with the name "puzzle_input.txt".

Once you've created the `.gitignore` file, you can add it to your repository using the following commands:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
git push
```

After adding and committing the `.gitignore` file, you can push your changes to GitHub to apply the exclusion rule.

Yes, you can ignore all `.txt` files by adding the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
*.txt
```

This will tell Git to ignore any files with the `.txt` extension, regardless of their name or location within your repository.

By ignoring all `.txt` files, you can prevent any text files containing puzzle inputs from being uploaded to GitHub.

So, your updated `.gitignore` file would look like this:

```
*.txt
```

Save the file and add it to your repository as before:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
git push
```

Now, any `.txt` files in your repository will be ignored by Git.

You can ignore your virtual environment by adding the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
env/
```

This will tell Git to ignore the entire `env` directory, which is where your virtual environment is stored.

So, your updated `.gitignore` file would look like this:

```
*.txt
env/
```

By ignoring the `env` directory, you'll prevent your virtual environment from being uploaded to GitHub.

Note that you can also use the more general pattern `venv/` to ignore any virtual environment directory, regardless of its name.

Alternatively, you can use the following pattern to ignore any directory that is likely to be a virtual environment:

```
*/env/
*/venv/
*.env
```

This will ignore any directory named `env` or `venv`, as well as any file named `.env`.
